# k-Nearest-Neighbors-classification-demo
### This is to demonstrate how KNeighbors classification model can be used for a classification problem in machine learning. It will help to understand the basic steps in developing KNN model and verifying the prediction accuracy as well as confidence measure/probability of model's predictions.
